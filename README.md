# Call Manager
##An Adaptive Interaction Manager Application

As the number of communication channels increase, so should be the opportunities for
individuals to interact. Yet, we all fail to interact eciently. For example, we fail to return
important calls, read important messages in time, or resort to a phone call when the person
we want to reach is a few feet away. We can attribute the situation to social applications
that focus more on what to do and how to do something, rather than why to do it. Consider
that a user employs an agent to manage his interactions. The agent decides when and how
to remind the user of a missed interaction opportunity. 

###Consider the following scenarios:
 A user misses a call during work hours. However, the caller's agent noties the user's
(callee's) agent that the call was important. Then, the user's agent reminds the user
immediately.

 A user missed a call from a friend the previous evening and the user's agent didn't
remind the user of the call as the call was casual. However, today, when the user is
jogging in a park, the friend is also jogging in the same park. The agent, then, reminds
the user of the missed call and the proximity to the friend. Note that the friend's agent
may not always want to disclose the friend's location to the user's agent due to privacy
concerns.

 A user forgot his phone at home and a friend tries to call him repeatedly. The user's
agent knows about the user forgetting the phone and asks the caller to send an email
to the user.
